## 前言

最近在研究客户转化率，感觉始终差一口气，没有找到突破口。我也想从客户那里获取一些信息，辅助我的判断，但是一般客户都不愿意透露一些真实情况，所以我只能从其它渠道入手。

比如我在全球范围内找曾经有采购经验的人士，从他们那里听听关于如何选择供应商以及其中一些不为人知的故事，这样对于我分析客户画像、理解客户需求有些许帮助。知己知彼，百战不殆。

在这之前我接触过几个采购，但是他们的回答以及一些见解大多老生常谈，并没有给我太多的启发。而这次接触的buyer具有四十多年的采购经验，是比较大型公司的采购出身，他在回答一些问题的时候条理清晰、逻辑缜密。

所以，我想写下这篇博客，进行一些梳理和归纳。

## 第一次对话（2023年12月3日）

**==Rolen==**：**你在选择供应商的时候看重什么呢？**

> What I look for is total overall cost and by that I mean not just the price but also the shipping the quality component if there’s a quality and then I also look at payment terms.
> 
> Because right now companies want to hang on payment terms so my company we try to push for 90day payment terms which means we don’t have to pay them for 90 days after taking receipt of their material and that gives it it helps your cash flow situation out right.
> 
> So I look so I so when I’ve been looking a lot lately and I’ve been getting our buyers to look at is okay we’ve got these three suppliers all three of them prices are very close this one may be have the highest slightly higher prices but it’s located right here in Maine we don’t pay any shipping costs this one might be in Ohio this one might be in California shipping cost like four five $3,000 so when you add in the freight this one here is actually even though on paper it looks like it’s higher it’s actually cheaper and it may have a better reputation you know as far as quality goes because you may have some you know you get some background information on these suppliers find out what they’re all about but a big thing that we’re looking now is at you know pay terms too you know you want to have companies that are flexible on their payment terms U and if they’re a brand new supplier let’s say you’ve never ordered from them before brand new I think you also have to look at their financial capabilities are they financially doing well or is there a possibility that they could go bankrupt or close their doors because they’re not financially sound and when people when when suppliers aren’t financially sound they cut corners on quality and they cut corner on costs and that affects your product too so those are the kind of things I look at in addition to communication because communication as you know very vital if your supplier says I will have it on your dock October 1st and they consistently do that thumbs up but if they’re always late U and you’re missing dates for your customers then they’re not going to be a very good supplier.

> **Chat GPT翻译：**  
> 我关注的是总体成本，这不仅包括产品价格，还考虑了运费、质量组件（如果有的话），以及支付条件。
> 
> 目前，很多公司都倾向于延长支付周期，因此我们公司试图推动采用90天的支付条件，这意味着我们在收到他们的材料后有90天的时间来付款，有助于改善我们的现金流状况。
> 
> 因此，我一直在着重考虑的是，最近我们的采购人员开始看的是这样的情况：我们有三个供应商，他们的价格非常接近，其中一个价格可能稍高一些，但它位于缅因州，我们无需支付任何运费。另一个可能在俄亥俄州，还有一个可能在加利福尼亚，运费可能是四五千美元。
> 
> 当考虑运费时，尽管从纸面上看这个价格更高，但实际上它更便宜，而且它可能声誉更好，尤其在质量方面，因为你可以获取一些有关这些供应商的背景信息。目前我们非常注重的另一个方面是支付条件，我们希望与那些在支付条件上更为灵活的公司合作。
> 
> 如果是一家全新的供应商，也就是说你以前从未与他们订购过产品，我认为你还需要关注他们的财务能力，他们目前的经济状况如何，或者有可能破产或倒闭吗，因为当供应商的财务状况不佳时，他们会在质量和成本上偷工减料，这也会影响到你的产品。这些是我在选择供应商时关注的事项。
> 
> 除此之外，沟通也是非常关键的，因为正如你所知，如果你的供应商说他们会在10月1日前将货物交到你的码头，并且他们能够始终如一地做到，那就是好的。但如果他们总是迟交货，你错过了客户的交货日期，那么他们就不会是一个很好的供应商。

**Rolen总结：**

总体成本，产品质量，财务情况，付款条件，沟通、准时交货

---

**==Rolen==**：**你谈到你会看整体成本，那么是如何去计算这些成本呢，因为产品价格以及运费这种有形的成本很好计算，但是涉及到一些无形的成本，比如沟通、精力、时间等等，你们是如何去衡量的呢？**

> One of the things right now that xxx is really big on is something called sustainability sustainability is something right now that I don’t know if you guys you’re you’re going to hear about it at some point especially if you’re working in Europe sustainability is very big right now because if you can cut if you can reduce your freight costs you know that Greenhouse emission gas emission from Vehicles if you’re shipping it from across the other side of your country that’s a big win for our company.
> 
> As far as they look at if you can keep lower um inventory on hand you know frees up more space for other items in your Warehouse too so you’re not like overloaded on certain because you have that long lead time or long shipping thing on there.
> 
> But sustainability is very big, you know we also give preference to companies that are powered by something other than electrical or gas right now I have two huge suppliers and both of them are solar powered and solar power solar powered 100% their their plants are 100% solar powered.
> 
> So my company gives preference to suppliers that are you know energy efficient and also are sustain you know show that they have sustainability practices in place you know for and and maybe that’s not as big a thing in China but in the United States if you want to get a government contract you have to look at they have to show some sustainability and you also have to have something called diversity which means you have to have some uh suppliers that fall under this category they can be women suppliers or minority owned suppliers or whatever there’s a certain Target number we have to hit every year.
> 
> In the United States uh especially if we want to do government contracts you probably don’t have to deal with that there though do you it’s more complicated in in USA I think it is more complicated when you’re dealing with the United States government that is very United States government had they set out certain rules about percentages of what you you have to have for like this and that and that and before you bid on it you have to have all these things in place.

> **Chat GPT翻译：**
> 
> 目前 xxx 公司非常关注的一个方面是可持续性，这是一项目前在欧洲等地尤为重要的概念。可持续性是一个你们可能会在某个时候听说的东西，尤其是如果你们在欧洲工作的话。可持续性目前非常受重视，因为如果你能减少货运成本，尤其是从国家的另一端运输，可以减少运输过程中产生的温室气体排放，对我们公司来说是一个重要的胜利。
> 
> 此外，如果你能保持较低的库存水平，也就是手头上不用保存太多库存，这也会为仓库中的其他物品腾出更多的空间，这样你就不会因为有长时间的交货周期或长途运输而在某些物品上过度负载。
> 
> 可持续性是非常重要的，我们也更倾向于那些不仅仅依赖电力或天然气的公司。我现在有两个大供应商，它们都采用太阳能供电，百分之百使用太阳能，它们的工厂完全由太阳能供电。
> 
> 因此，我们公司更青睐那些能源效率高且具有可持续性实践的供应商。在美国，如果你想获得政府合同，你必须展示一些可持续性，还必须具备一种被称为”多样性”的要素，这意味着你必须拥有一些符合这一类别的供应商，可能是女性供应商或少数族裔拥有的供应商等等。
> 
> 在美国，我们每年都有一定的目标要达到，特别是如果我们想要与政府签约的话。你们可能在那里不需要处理这些问题，对吧？
> 
> 我认为在美国处理这些问题更加复杂，尤其是当你与美国政府打交道时，因为他们对百分比等方面设定了一些规则，你在投标之前必须要有所有这些事情的准备。

**==Rolen==：对你来说，哪些供应商算得上是一个好的供应商呢？**

> I have one supplier right now that we’ve started work we worked with them for many years and now I’m expanding on what we’ve been working on I’m adding a new product line with them cartons I used to just see printed material now they’re doing cartons too printed cartons what makes a good Spire partnership partnership they understand our needs they know we need you know we look we constantly look for short lead time orders for emergencies they know the quality has to be here um what I look for is a supplier that has a A can do ratio like nearly 100% they say they can do it and they do it you know they deliver one they say they’re going to they deliver a high quality product they’re you know literally they’re like Partners to us and I look at this Franklin printing that we have up in main here they’re literally like a a partner to us and every I’m I I talk to them almost like I do to our employees
> 
> because we have you know like my buyers or whatever because I know um and they know that their future viability as a company because they do such a large amount of business with xxx it depends on us and we depend on them for like our key products as well because we couldn’t find them as cheap anywhere else and the quality and on time delivery is first P
> 
> so I guess what I would what it really boils down to is just um partnership great communication honest they have to be honest in good integrity and I like a supplier that there is a mistake made they stand behind it they don’t hide and run for cover they don’t blame you know the you know somebody else it’s your fault or whatever they’ll take ownership for the mistake and then they take care of it and that’s the way xx operates and that’s what I would call my ideal supplier.
> 
> **Chat GPT翻译：**
> 
> 目前我们有一家供应商，我们与他们合作已经很多年了，现在我正在扩展我们的合作，增加一个新的产品线——纸盒。之前我们主要是与他们合作印刷材料，现在他们还开始制作印刷纸盒。对于一个优秀的供应商合作伙伴，我认为以下几点是关键的：
> 
> **了解我们的需求：**
> 
> - 他们理解我们需要短交货周期订单以应对紧急情况。
> - 他们知道产品质量对我们至关重要。
> 
> **履行承诺：**
> 
> - 我寻找的是供应商的“能做到比”接近100%。他们说能做到的事情，几乎都能做到。
> - 提供高质量的产品，按照承诺的时间交货。
> 
> **建立伙伴关系：**
> 
> - 他们不仅仅是供应商，而是我们的合作伙伴。
> - 他们被视为我们的合作伙伴，我们之间的沟通非常紧密。
> 
> **沟通：**
> 
> - 优秀的沟通是关键，我与他们的交流方式几乎与与公司员工的交流一样频繁。
> - 我知道，他们的未来生存与公司的业务数量有关，因为他们与我们的业务很多，我们也依赖他们，尤其是对于一些关键产品，因为我们在其他地方找不到更便宜的，并且他们的质量和准时交货是首要的。
> 
> **诚实和正直：**
> 
> - 我喜欢一个供应商，如果发生了错误，他们会站在错误的一方，而不是回避责任，也不会推卸责任。
> - 他们会承认错误，然后采取措施进行纠正。
> 
> 总的来说，我理想中的供应商是一个与我们建立了紧密伙伴关系、沟通良好、诚实正直、在承诺方面表现出色并且愿意对错误负责的供应商。 xxx 就是我理想中的供应商，他们的运作方式符合这些标准。

**==Rolen==：我们是一家小公司，所以当我们联系客户的很难跟他们建立起信任关系，你有什么建议给我吗？**

> if I was dealing with a small supplier like right now what I would do is I’d start small I mean I and I do I have a small supplier here in Maine I’m gonna start out with I’m not going to throw them 20% of the business or even 10% of the business we’re going to start off with a couple orders we’re going to see how they do and once they meet those orders and they prove to me they can get there on time uh and the quality is good then I’m gonna increase the orders but you know like you said the total cost has got is very important right but the cost the total cost of an item that’s going to get your foot in the door so to speak that’s going to get the attention of your European customers it’s going to be your price that’s how you’re going to start but what’s going to maintain that relationship is going to be getting it there on time having good quality and good Communications and once you establish that over time over time you’re G to be able to get contct you’ll get bigger contracts but I’m going to the same thing right now with the small main supplier here I’m on the phone with them and I was I was on a phone with them Friday you know I’m just assuring them you know hey we’re still working to get you set up and I need your prices and I and they know to get your foot in the door you have to show me you know good pricing and once that’s established everything will kind of fall into place after that you know.
> 
> absolutely on time delivery is very is very key you know and having some face and good communication and could involve teams call you know on a regular BAS basis it you know it could could involve somebody traveling there and meeting them firsthand or going to a trade show maybe and seeing them or something like that but you really wanna the face-to-face interaction is important too I mean if you’re just getting emails from somebody I don’t know I don’t I don’t like dealing just in emails alone I like to see somebody’s face and look in their you know you know what I mean teams calls do you have yeah so I think that’s important to have that interaction as well
> 
> **Chat GPT翻译：**
> 
> 如果我正在与一个小型供应商打交道，那么我会从小开始。我有一个缅因州的小供应商，我会从一些小订单开始，而不是一下子给予他们20%甚至10%的业务份额。我们将开始一些小订单，看看他们的表现。一旦他们完成了这些订单并证明他们能够准时交货，质量也好，那么我会增加订单量。
> 
> 就像你所说的，总成本非常重要，但成本是让你迈出第一步的关键，这样说来，它能够引起你欧洲客户的注意，就是你的价格。但能够维持这种关系的将是准时交货、高质量和良好的沟通。
> 
> 一旦你在一段时间内建立了这些，你将能够获得更大的合同。我现在正与缅因州的一个小供应商做同样的事情。我和他们通了电话，上周五我还在和他们通电话，我向他们保证，我们仍在努力使他们能够参与进来，我需要他们的价格。
> 
> 他们知道为了打开局面，他们必须给我一个良好的价格，一旦这个建立起来，其他一切就会顺理成章。
> 
> 准时交货非常关键，还有面对面的交流。这可能包括定期的团队电话，甚至可能涉及某人前往他们的地方亲自会面，或者参加贸易展览之类的活动。但你真的想要面对面的互动也是很重要的。如果你只是通过电子邮件交流，我不喜欢仅仅通过电子邮件来处理事务，我想亲自看到某人的面孔，与他们进行交流。

**==Rolen==：你在跟中国供应商沟通的时候有什么gap，比如文化上的**

> the only issue that we had in the past really to speak of is the Chinese New Year because they say they take such a long period of time off you know to celebrate the holiday that you have to really build up inventory well before the Chinese um New Year starts and then when they come back from Chinese New Year and this is just my impression and and I think what it was communicated to me a lot of times the people that work in the manufacturing facility in China a lot of them decide not to come back they want to stay in their Province or wherever so sometimes there’s a gap after the Chinese New Year to start ordering get things back up again because of they do tend to lose employees during the Chinese holiday because some of them decide not to come back and and where that comes into play is if you have like a certain production line where there’s only one or two people trained on it and you’re missing one or two of those people because after they they said not come back to work um you know it it can set you back and it happened to me personally so I know it can happen when I when we work from e but um those are really those are the big things right there.
> 
> **Chat GPT翻译：**
> 
> 一个我们过去真正存在的问题就是中国的春节，因为他们会休息很长时间来庆祝这个节日，你必须在中国新年开始前很长时间就开始建立库存。然后，当他们从中国新年休息回来时，这只是我的印象，也是很多次被告知的，中国制造厂的工人中有很多人决定不回来工作，他们想要留在自己的省份或其他地方。
> 
> 因此，有时在中国新年后重新开始订购和重新启动业务时可能会存在一些间隔，因为他们在春节期间确实会失去一些员工，因为其中一些人决定不回来工作。这会涉及到的问题是，如果你有一个生产线，只有一两个人受过培训，而你失去了其中一两个人，因为他们决定不回来工作，你可能会陷入困境。
> 
> 这对我个人来说确实发生过，所以我知道这种情况确实可能发生，当我们与中国合作时，这确实是一个大问题。
