## 前言

在接触我的商业教练James之前，我根本不知道还有商业教练这个概念，而且跟James的交流我总会能学到很多东西，所以在某种程度上他打开了我的许多认知。

我眼中的James，是开明的、友善的、幽默的、专业的、热情的、自律的、富有童心的，讲原则的、包容的、善于倾听的。拥有其中的一个优点并不难，但是将这许多优点合在一起，放到一个人的身上却并不容易。

在这一年里，我从他身上学到了很多东西（商业、销售、心态、习惯等等），有了一些成长和突破，所以我想写下这篇文章来记录我与他之间的点滴。

## 初识

我从去年开始就有意识地在全球范围内寻找我的导师，经过一番研究，我通过一个学习平台认识了来自全球各地的人，这其中就包括James。

我记得他的自我介绍简介视频做得很专业，给我的第一印象很好，所以我打算试试他的课。

那天是2022年11月20日，我跟他远程聊了一会。聊完的感觉就是这个老师给我的印象似乎很严格，比较严肃，但是教学方法很独特，不走寻常路。我向来喜欢做一些不一样的事情，不喜欢循规蹈矩地做事，所以打算继续了解一下他。

我跟他的第二次聊天是在2022年11月25日，跟上次完全不一样的是，这一次的James给我的感觉很幽默、很放松，我能感觉到他所释放的能量，所以跟他相谈甚欢。

## 相处默契

在之后的几个月里，我都没有找其它老师，一直跟James上课，一直持续到现在。我跟James相处起来很轻松，所以我很期待跟他上课，跟他上课也让我觉得很开心。

毫不夸张地说，James是我在这个平台上最信赖的导师。

他热情、包容、善于倾听和鼓励，给我了很大的动力。这其中有几件事让我印象很是深刻：

### 1. 精益求精的态度

我在写营销文案上碰到了问题，于是跟James进行探讨，James跟我说了一些销售主张和英文one-liner的写法，然后我结合Chat GPT写了上百个one-liner的文案，James一点都不厌烦，一个一个帮我修改，以母语者的角度琢磨词句，这个场景让我特别感动。因为这让我想到了我的研究生导师，他以前改我论文的时候也是带着这份姿态，一字一句地琢磨词句。

所以看到那个场景我的回忆瞬间被拉到我读研的时光，特别温馨、感动。

### 2. 别出心裁的创意

另外，我在客户开发的时候同样出现问题，是James帮我想主意，给我提供源源不断的主意，让我拥有了更多的视野。他传授给我的其中一个主意，我在执行后受到了非常好的效果，辅助我开发出了两个大客户，顺利打开了市场的局面，我也因此从中获得了启发。

我现在还会时不时想起他经常跟我说的Gap-selling，以及zig while others zag，就是做一些别人不会做或者不敢做的事，往往能收到意想不到的效果，我理解的就是差异化。

我从中获得了很多的启发，也用在了人际关系、商业关系上，得到了很好的效果。

### 3. 真正的聪明

我曾经有问过James，就是他见过的人里面，哪些是他觉得真正优秀的呢？James问我是不是指的是聪明，我说差不多意思。

他说他眼里的聪明不是那些智商高、善于算计的人，而是头脑极度开明（open-minded）的人。

这个观点很新颖，让我对聪明这个词有了新的理解。

### 4. 习惯比意愿更重要

另外，我跟James曾经争论过一个人能否坚持做一件事的本质原因是什么？

我的理解是只要一个人想做成一件事的意愿足够强大，是很容易坚持下去的。而James的理解是，一个人做成一件事的意愿强大固然重要，但是一个人虽然很有意愿去做一件事，但是当他/她的能量不够大的时候，同样无法坚持下去。所以通过养成习惯的方式，可以在无形中让他/她坚持下去。

我汲取了James的观点，觉得他说的同样有道理，这也是为什么我愿意跟James一起养商业习惯的原因之一。

现在，我也慢慢地觉察到他说这些话背后的逻辑了。

## 后记

James对我而言，亦师亦友，是我前进路上不可缺少的动力源泉，我很喜欢跟他聊天，他的幽默、开明、善于倾听和包容的心态，是我学习的榜样。过去一年的时间，我从他身上汲取了很多营养，也获得了一些启发和突破，我很幸运能认识到这样的人。

总有些人出现在你的生命里，给你带来影响，让你成为更好的人，而James，就是这样的人。

## Preface

Before I encountered my business coach, James, I had no idea about the concept of a business coach. However, through my interactions with James, I always found myself learning a great deal. In a sense, he has opened up many facets of my awareness.

In my eyes, James is open-minded, friendly, humorous, professional, passionate, disciplined, and youthful. He upholds principles, is inclusive, and excels at listening. Possessing any one of these qualities isn’t difficult, but combining so many in one person is not common.

Over the past year, I have learned a lot from him—business strategies, sales techniques, mindset, habits, and more. I’ve experienced personal growth and breakthroughs, prompting me to write this article to document the moments between us.

## First Encounter

Since last year, I consciously sought a mentor on a global scale. After some research, I connected with people worldwide through a learning platform, and that’s where I found James.

I remember his professionally done introduction video, leaving a positive first impression. Intrigued, I decided to try his classes.

It was on November 20, 2022, that I had a remote chat with him. The initial impression was that he seemed strict and serious, but his teaching methods were unique and unconventional—a style I appreciate. Being someone who likes doing things differently and not adhering strictly to norms, I decided to further explore.

My second conversation with him took place on November 25, 2022. To my surprise, this time James gave off a humorous and relaxed vibe, and I could feel the positive energy he exuded. We clicked, and the conversation flowed naturally.

## Harmonious Interaction

In the following months, I exclusively continued classes with James, not seeking other mentors. Our interactions were easy-going, and I always looked forward to our sessions. Without exaggeration, James has become the mentor I trust the most on this platform.

His enthusiasm, inclusiveness, attentive listening, and encouragement provided me with significant motivation. A few instances left a deep impression:

1. **Pursuit of Excellence:**  
    When I faced challenges in crafting marketing copy, I discussed it with James. He shared sales principles and ways to structure English one-liners. I combined his advice with Chat GPT to create hundreds of one-liners, and James tirelessly helped me refine each one. His approach, reminiscent of my graduate advisor, touched me deeply, taking me back to the warm memories of my academic years.
2. **Innovative Ideas:**  
    In client development, I encountered challenges, and James came to the rescue with a multitude of ideas, broadening my perspectives. One of his suggestions, when implemented, yielded excellent results, assisting me in securing two major clients and successfully establishing a foothold in the market. I often recall his advice on “Gap-selling” and “zig while others zag”—doing things others wouldn’t or dare not do, often yielding unexpected results. This concept of differentiation inspired me and proved effective in interpersonal and business relationships.
3. **True Intelligence:**  
    I once asked James about the people he considers truly outstanding. He clarified whether I meant intelligence, and I agreed. His response was that true intelligence, in his eyes, isn’t about high IQ or calculating abilities but having an extremely open mind. This novel perspective reshaped my understanding of the term “intelligence.”
4. **Habits Matter More Than Intentions:**  
    James and I once debated the fundamental reason behind a person’s ability to persist in doing something. While I believed that strong intentions make it easy to persevere, James argued that even with strong intentions, a person may lack the necessary energy to endure. Therefore, forming habits can unconsciously help maintain perseverance. I absorbed James’s viewpoint, finding logic behind his words, which is one reason I willingly adopted business habits under his guidance.

Now, I’m gradually realizing the underlying logic behind his words.

## Afterword

James is both a mentor and a friend to me, an indispensable source of motivation on my journey forward. I enjoy our conversations, and his humor, open-mindedness, attentive listening, and inclusive mindset serve as a model for my learning. Over the past year, I have gained nourishment and insights from him, experiencing moments of inspiration and breakthrough. I consider myself fortunate to have crossed paths with someone like James.

Certain individuals enter your life, leaving an impact and shaping you into a better person. James is one such person.
